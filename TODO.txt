Add a feature to automatically upload a document to DecisionDesk.

1. Get user auth or read a config file
2. Launch Chrome using selenium
3. Login to DecisionDesk
4. Scan 'ready' folder, compare against roster for active with ddid
5. For each valid document:
    1. Get url
    2. If document.filename not on page (document): 
        - Select admin upload
        - Upload file
        - Select file
        - Plug file values
        
Issues:
- DecisionDesk site is unreliable, many tests/waits will have to be used
- How to prevent duplicate uploads or allow when filenames are the same but contents are not?
    - Maybe hash the file and put it somewhere in the doc attrs on dd?
